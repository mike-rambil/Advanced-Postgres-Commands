 Let’s break it down, Micheal-style—blunt, skeptical, and straight from the trench.

## 🧱 SQL `.sql` / `.backup` Files vs WAL-G Backups

These are **not** the same beast. In fact, they come from *very* different schools of thought:

### 🧾 1. **SQL Dump Files (`.sql`)**

* Made by `pg_dump`.
* Literally a **text file full of SQL statements**:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (...);
  INSERT INTO users VALUES (...);
  ```
* Restored with `psql`:

  ```bash
  psql mydb < backup.sql
  ```
* Not a physical backup. Doesn’t include internal PostgreSQL system files.
* Good for:

  * Small DBs
  * Schema-only backups
  * Git versioning backups
  * Moving data between Postgres versions

### 📦 2. **Custom / Directory Backups (`.backup`)**

* Made by `pg_dump -Fc` or `-Fd`.
* Binary format (not human-readable).
* Restored with `pg_restore`.

  ```bash
  pg_restore -d mydb backup.backup
  ```
* More flexible than `.sql` (e.g., selective table restore).
* Still **logical backup**, not physical.
* Doesn’t include WAL files, which means **no Point-In-Time Recovery**.

### ☁️ 3. **WAL-G Backups**

* **Physical backup**, not logical.
* It snapshots the actual **PostgreSQL data directory** (`PGDATA`).
* Includes **WAL (Write-Ahead Logs)** so you can:

  * Do **PITR** (roll forward to a specific point)
  * Restore a crashed or corrupted DB
  * Clone replicas like a boss
* It’s like freezing the brain of Postgres and being able to revive it exactly as it was.
* Used for:

  * Disaster recovery
  * HA setups
  * Cloning instances

## 🧠 TL;DR — Are `.sql` / `.backup` files the same as WAL-G?

| Feature                    | `.sql` / `.backup` (pg\_dump) | WAL-G                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Backup type                | Logical                       | Physical                      |
| Human-readable             | `.sql` = yes, `.backup` = no  | No                            |
| Speed of restore           | Slower                        | Fast (esp. with WAL + base)   |
| PITR (Point-in-time)       | ❌ Nope                        | ✅ Yup                         |
| WAL included               | ❌ Nope                        | ✅ Yup                         |
| For migration/portability  | ✅ Great                       | ⚠️ Kinda clunky               |
| For full disaster recovery | ❌ Nope                        | ✅ This is the one             |
| Version-agnostic           | ✅ Mostly                      | ❌ Needs same Postgres version |

## So Which Should *You* Use?

* Just need a backup of schema/data, not super time-sensitive, and you're okay reimporting?
  → **Use `.sql` or `.backup`**

* Running production DBs where uptime, crash recovery, and replication matter?
  → **Use WAL-G or pgBackRest**

Mixing them is also valid:

* Daily logical dumps for migrations/version control.
* Hourly WAL-G backups for real disaster recovery.
